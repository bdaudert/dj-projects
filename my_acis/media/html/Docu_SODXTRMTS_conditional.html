<b>CONDITIONAL PARAMETERS</b><br />
<b>Base temperature </b>If you choose Heating, Cooling or Growing Degrees as your climate element, please choose your base temperature. For example, Cooling Degree Days are caluclated as folows: (max temp - min temp)/2 - base temperature<br />
<b>Degree Day Calculation</b><br />
<ul>
    <li><b>Heating Degree Days </b>base temperature - (max temperature - min temperature)/2 </li>
    <li><b>Cooling Degree Days </b>(max temperature - min temperature)/2 - base temperature</li>
    <li><b>Growing degree Days </b>(max temperature - min temperature)/2 - base temperature</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>Thresholds for "Number of Days" statistic</b> Fill out this sub section if your monthly statitic is "Number of Days."<br />
    <ul>
        <li><b>Less greater or between </b>Count the number of days less than/greater than or between threshold(s).</li> 
        <li><b>Threshold </b>If you choose less than or greater than above, enter your threshold here.</li>
        <li><b>Above/Below </b>If you choose between above, enter your lower(Above) and upper(Below) thresholds here.</li>
    </ul>

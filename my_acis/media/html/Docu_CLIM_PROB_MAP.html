    <p class="error">What is the <b>Climate Probability Map</b> Tool?</p>
    <p>An interactive tool to generate climate probability maps for temperature and precipitation. Maps can be generated for individula US states or user defined bounding boxes, different temperature and precipitation threshholds and time windows.</p>
    <p class="error">What datasets can be used?</p>
    <p>This tool works with  the NRCC interpolated, NRCC Hi-Resolution daily gridded datasets developed at NRCC (Northern Regional Climate Center)
    as well as with a variety of NARCCAP modeled datasets.

    <p>For more information on NRCC interpolated, NRCC Hi-Resolution:</p>

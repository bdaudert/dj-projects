    <p class="error">What is this tool?</p>
    <p>An interactive tool to generate climate probability maps<br /> 
    for temperature and precipitation.<br />
    Maps can be generated for individual US states,<br />
    Counties, Climate Divisions, Basins, County Warning Areas or</p>
    custom shapes
    </p>
    <p class="error">What datasets can be used?</p>
    <p>This tool works with the NRCC interpolated and the <br />
    NRCC Hi-Resolution daily gridded datasets developed at<br />
    NRCC (Northern Regional Climate Center)<br />
    as well as with a variety of NARCCAP modeled datasets.

    <p>For more information on NRCC interpolated, NRCC Hi-Resolution:</p>

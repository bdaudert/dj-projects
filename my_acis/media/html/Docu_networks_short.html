<div id="Docu_Short_WBAN" align="left">
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="WBAN">Weather-Bureau-Army-Navy</a></b></font><br />
Weather Bureau Army Navy network. WBAN identifiers were an effort to standardize meteorological identifiers in the 1950s and 1960s. Five-digit WBAN identifiers generally, but not exclusively, apply to aviation facilities. Stations in this network likely have an ICAO, FAA, and/or NWSLI indicator and may also have a GHCN-D, WMO, or COOP identifier as well.

<div id="Docu_Short_COOP" align="left">
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="COOP">Cooperative Observer Program</a></b></font><br />
National Weather Service Cooperative Observer network. Volunteer observers make daily observations for this network at stations throughout the US and its territories. Observations in the COOP network begin as early as the mid- to late-1800s. Stations in this network may also have a GHCN-D, ICAO, NWSLI, FAA, WMO, or WBAN identifier.

<p><font size="3"><b><a name="SNOTEL">SNOTEL-Daily</a></b></font>
SNOwpack TELemetry stations operated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. SNOTEL stations were first installed in the late 70s. Sub-daily observations made at SNOTEL stations are aggregated into daily observations of mean, max, and min temperature and precipitation to create the SNOTEL-Daily dataset. These daily data are part of the GHCN-D database.

<div id="Docu_Short_Threadex" align="left">
<p><font size="3"><b><a name="Threadex">ThreadEx</a></b></font><br />
Climatological records where data from two or more station records are “threaded” together to create one continuous, long-term record for a location, typically in major metropolitan areas. Threadex records are built from GHCN-D records and exist for 270 locations in the US.

<b>Aim</b>:<br />
To investigate the implications of a changing climate on California Spotted Owl habitat in the Central Sierra Province.
<br /><br />
<b>Resource management application:</b><br />
The US Forest Service and others involved in natural resource management are interested in identifying climate extremes relative to thermal tolerances of individual species that are targets of management. For spotted owls, at temperatures above 35.2˚C the resting metabolic rate increases substantially and behavioral responses to heat stress have been observed at temperatures from 30–34˚C.
<br /><br />
<b>Description</b>:<br />
The elevation within the spotted owl territory is highly variable (Figure 1) and therefore temperatures vary dramatically within relatively close spatial distances (Figure 2a).  Historically, average summer daytime temperatures occurred in the range of 19-32°C depending on location.  By the end of the 21st century these are projected to reach 25-39°C (Figure 2b). Considering the full distribution of the daily temperature probability functions (Figure 3), we find that the lower elevations will exceed the critical threshold for the majority of summer days.  For example, at low-elevation point X the critical threshold was exceeded only 5% of the time historically, but projections suggest it will be exceeded 50-71% of the time by the end of the century, depending on model.  Higher elevations could be more habitable for the owl species.  At high-elevation point Y the critical tolerance threshold is projected to be exceeded 0-5% of the time by the end of the century.  While there may be locations within the territory that remain cool enough for the owl species, the amount of space will be limited.  If we assume that the Spotted Owl species can tolerate a few critically hot days in a summer (say 5% of summer days), then historically 84% of the domain would support the Owl based on these criteria.  Projections for the end of the 21st century suggest this space will reduce to 8-32%, depending on model.  

<br /><br />
<b>Methods</b>:<br />
Skew-normal probability distribution functions were fit to summer (June-August) daily maximum temperature (Tmax) data.  The fit was done first for the historical climate period 1961-1990 from observational data and from ten LOCA downscaled CMIP5 models, and then for the end of the 21st Century (2070-2099) projections run under the RCP8.5 “business as usual” greenhouse gas emissions scenario.  By this methodology, the full summer temperature probability distribution is represented by only three parameters (location, scale, and shape).  The probability of exceeding any thermal tolerance threshold can be determined from these three parameters.  For this analysis, we use 35.2˚C as the thermal tolerance threshold for the California Spotted Owl.

The sold gray shading highlights temperatures above the thermal tolerance threshold of the California Spotted Owl.  The locations of low-elevation point X and high-elevation point Y are shown in Figure 2.  At point X, historically the critical threshold was exceeded only about 5% the time while in the future this is projected to increase to 50-71%, depending on model.  At point Y, the critical threshold was not exceeded historically and future projections suggest it will be exceeded only 0-5% of the time.

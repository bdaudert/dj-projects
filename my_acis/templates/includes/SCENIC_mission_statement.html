            SCENIC is a web page under development at the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC)<br />
            as part of WRCCâ€™s contribution to the Southwest Climate Science Center (SWCSC).

            <br /><br />The purpose of SCENIC is to support the research and decision making efforts of the SW-CSC,
            <br />the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCC), and other stakeholders 
                  concerned with natural resource management. 

            <br /><br />The web pages serve as an access point for climate data and analysis tools 
                  for the Southwest <br />as well as the rest of the contiguous U.S.

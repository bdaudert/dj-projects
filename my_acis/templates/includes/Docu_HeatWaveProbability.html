<b>Aim</b>:<br />
To investigate the implications of a changing climate on heat wave probabilities at a high spatial resolution over the geographically and climatically complex Southwest US.<br /><br />
<b>Resource management application:</b><br />

<br /><br />
<b>Description</b>:<br />
    Changes in heat wave probability do not directly follow changes in background warming (Figure 1).  Background warming in the Southwest is greatest in the northern part of the domain (Figure 1a), however, the largest increases in heat wave probability occurs in the central part of the domain (Figure 1b).  This is because temperature PDFs in the Southwest US are non-Gaussian and asymmetric with shapes that vary considerably across the region.  Locations with shorter warm tails would see a greater increase in heat wave probability than would locations having longer warm tails under the same amount of warming.  Additionally, subtle changes in the PDF shape can also affect future heat wave probabilities. Badlands National Park (BNP) in South Dakota, for example, is projected to experience a larger increase in daily maximum temperatures than is projected for the Colorado National Monument (CNM).  Specifically, a 7.6 °C shift in central tendency is projected for BNP versus 4.4 °C for CNM.  In terms of heat wave probability, however, CNM is projected to experience more heat waves. Both the BNP and CNM distributions are negatively skewed, but the temperature PDF at CNM has shorter warm tails and a smaller variance.  Shifting distributions with shorter warm tails results in a larger increase in heat wave probability because the higher density portion of the PDF curve is closer to the historical 95th percentile threshold (Figure 2).  At CNM, 71% of summer days are projected to exceed the historical heat wave threshold, compared to 45% for BNP.  Similarly, for record heat, projections for CNM show record temperatures occurring on 33% of days compared to 2% for BNP.

<b>Methods</b>:<br />
    To study the relationships between background warming and heat wave probability, we first define a heat wave locally at each grid cell as days when temperatures exceed the historical (1961-1990) 95th percentile.  Next, we fit skew-normal probability distribution functions (PDF) to summer (June-August) daily maximum temperature (Tmax) data from historical simulations and future projections from ten LOCA downscaled CMIP5 models.  Background warming is defined as the shift in the temperature PDF measured as the change in the central tendency (or mode). It is more common to see the background warming described in terms of a change in the mean.  However, the mean can be unduly influenced by outliers, therefore the mode is a more precise measure.  For this analysis, we first computed the background warming (change in mode) projected for the end of the 21st century (Figure 1a).  Next we computed future heat wave probabilities defined as the probability of exceeding the historical (1961-1990) 95th percentile threshold (Figure 1b).  For this analysis we used the end of the 21st Century (2070-2099) projections run under the RCP8.5 “business as usual” greenhouse gas emissions scenario.

    <b>Figure 2</b>:
    Example showing two locations in the Southwest US that have different temperature PDFs. Background warming is greater at Badlands National Park than at Colorado National Monument.  However, future heat wave probability is projected to be greater at Colorado National Monument because of the shorter warm tails and smaller variance there.  Hot weather (orange) represents temperatures above the historical 95th percentile (heat waves) and record weather (red) represents temperatures not previously encountered.  Both locations additionally experience a change in PDF shape on top of the background warming.  The historical and projected temperature PDFs are based on the average from the ten LOCA downscaled CMIP5 models.<br />

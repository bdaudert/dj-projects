A cooperative station is a site where observations are taken or other services rendered by volunteers or contractors. More than 11,000 volunteers take observations on farms, in urban and suburban areas, National Parks, seashores, and mountaintops. Observers generally record temperature and precipitation daily and electronically send those reports daily to the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The COOP was formally created in 1890 under the Organic Act. Coop identifiers are 6-digit numbers.<br/>

The FAA location identifier (FAA LID) is a 3- or 4-digit alphanumeric designator. The Civil Aeronautics Administration began publishing three-letter identifiers starting in the 1940s. These were mostly for internal use and did not start appearing in planning documents for pilots until the mid-1960s. In many cases, a three-digit identifier can be "converted" to its ICAO form by adding the appropriate ICAO region letter as the first letter.<br/>

The WMO identifier scheme was introduced in 1948 by the International Meteorological Organization (later the WMO) to support the "International Meteorological Code". The WMO identifier relies on a 5-digit numeric code to identify a land weather station. The first two digits refer to the geographic area (70-79 North America). The last three digits are loosely referred to as the "station number". The WMO provides free access to all WMO identifier assignments on its website.<br/>

The ICAO location indicator system was developed around 1955 by the International Civil Aviation Administration. In 1967 the system was published formally. The ICAO code consists of 4-letter identifiers. As of
 September 2010, there were 13,946 official ICAO assignments in effect.<br/>

<div id="Docu_NWSLI" align="left">
<p><font size="3"><b><a class="link" name="NWSLI">National Weather Service Location Identifier (NWSLI)</a></b></font><br/>
The National Weather Service uses several schemes for identifying stations. It typically relies on the ICAO and WMO identifiers, although several weather forecast offices (WFOs) and weather radar sites that have moved away from airports have been given their own codes which do not conflict with existing codes. Recently it began using four-letter-plus-one-number identifiers for specialized weather requirements such as hydro-meteorological stations. These use three letters which are a mnemonic for the location, followed by the first letter of the U.S. state, followed by a numeral indicating the alphabetical order within that letter (for example, North Carolina stations end with N7). The mnemonic may be the nearest town, or the name of the stream, or a combination of the two; and the same names may be rearranged into different mnemonics for different nearby locations.<br/>

ThreadEx is a data set of extreme daily temperature and precipitation values for 270 locations in the United States. For each day of the year at each station, ThreadEx provides the top 3 record high and low daily maximum temperatures, the top 3 record high and low daily minimum temperatures, the top 3 daily precipitation totals, along with the years the records were set for the date. This archive was developed for the express purpose of conveying general climate perspectives information. It is not appropriate for climate research.ThreadEx IDs consist of 6 characters, for example HSVthr.<br/>

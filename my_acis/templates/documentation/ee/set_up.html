    <h3>1. Authentication/Access</h3>
    <p>
    Follow the instructions below to set up your service account.<br />
    <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/earthengineapidocs/python-api">Oauth2 Instructions</a><br />
    Once you have set up your account, you can view your credentials (Account ID, email, keys) at the 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Console</a><br />
    Note that it is advantageous to add the Google EE account information to your environment variables:<br />
    In your .bashrc (.bash_profile on OSX), add these lines (xxxxxxx is your account number)<br />

    <pre class="code"><code>
    #Google Earth Engine env
    export EE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=xxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
    export EE_SERVICE_EMAIL= xxxxxxx@developer.gserviceaccount.com
    export EE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path_to_.p12_file
    </code></pre>

    <h3>2. Python API Installation</h3>
    <p>
    Follow the instructions below to set install the Earth Engine python API.<br />
    <a target="_blank" href="https://code.google.com/p/earthengine-api/wiki/Installation">EE python API installation</a>
    NOTE: Good luck with this! I had some issues installing pycrypto and openssl. 
    Unfortunately, I did not take notes a I was installing the API. 
    It took a long time, a combination of apt-get, port install, pi-install  and the addition of a few gray hairs
    to get all packages installed correctly. The best I can tell you is this: 
    Don't despair, google the error messages you get. User the developers forum to get help.

    <h3>3. Start playing</h3>
        <p>I recommend you start with these two examples:<br />

    <h4>General guidelines and tips from Dr. Britta</h4>
    <div>
    <h5>localhost versus appspot</h5>
    <p>
    Just because your code runs on your localhost does not mean it will run on appspot 
    This may be due to appspot not being able to locate one or more of the packages you are using.</p>
    <h5>Error messages and logs</h5>
    <p>
    If your browser and your developer console do not give you constructive error message, go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Console</a> and check the logs under the projects <b>Monitoring</b> tab on the left.
    </p>
    <h5>Effect of code changes</h5>
    <p>
    On localhost it is sufficient to reload your browser for code changes to take effect.
    For code changes to take effect on appspot, you will need to redeploy your code.
    </p>
    <p>Have fun!<br />

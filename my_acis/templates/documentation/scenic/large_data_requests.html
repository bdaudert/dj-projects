<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Due to bandwidth and computer memory limitations, large data request implementations over the web are problematic. A common method to overcome these difficulties is to execute the data jobs in the background rather than on the fly. After completion of the background data job, the results will be posted on an ftp server to be picked up by the user at his/her convenience.

<li> Scan content of the data directory at regular intervals (x minutes) to find new user input files containing the parameters of the data request. This is achieved via a background cron job running on the server. For each parameter file found:
<ul>
<li>Check if results file exists. If yes, notify user and continue to next parameter file.</li>
<li>If no results file exists, check if parameter file was created less than x minutes ago.</li>
<li>If file is older than x minutes, data request is in progress, continue to next file.</li>
<li>If file was created within last x minutes, execute data request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For each data request file found:
<ol>
<li>Execute the data request in background mode and write results to output file.</li>
<li>Move the output file to the ftp server.</li>
<li>Notify the user that his/her dataset is ready for pickup.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

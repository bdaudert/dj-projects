This is my (Britta Daudert) first ever django project in my very new job at 
the Desert Research Institute. 
I will attempt to get two types of user input:
1)  US state
2) RAWS site name (or UCAN id)
With this input, I will attempt to fetch the according 'graph of last seven days' page for the user to view. 
e.g. if US state is 'Hawaii' and RAWS station name is 'Kii Hawaii'
I want to fetch this url:
http://www.raws.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?hiHKII

Wish me luck!
